// Question 4
// Exercise 4 â€” Product Price Snapshot (Lists + Arithmetic)
// Inside main():
// 1) Create List prices = [15.5, 9.99, 42.0];
// 2) Create double tax = 0.14;
// 3) Compute the total with tax for the first two items only and print.
// 4) Print whether the third item is more expensive than the first two average.

void main() {
  List<double> prices = [15.5, 9.99, 42.0];
  double tax = 0.14;
  double total = (prices[0] + prices[1] * (1 + tax));
  print('Total with tax(first two) = $total');
  double avg = (prices[0] + prices[1] / 2);
  print(prices[2] > avg);
